```
yarn add react-native-pell-rich-editor

Also, follow instructions [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview) to add the native `react-native-webview` dependency.

-   [Example](./examples)

## `RichEditor`

The editor component. Simply place this component in your view hierarchy to receive a fully functional Rich text Editor.

`RichEditor` takes the following optional props:

-   `placeholder`

    Wrap the editor content placeholder

-   `initialContentHTML`

        	HTML that will be rendered in the content section on load.

-   `editorInitializedCallback`

        	A function that will be called when the editor has been initialized.

-   `editorStyle`

        	Styling for container or for Rich Editor more dark or light settings

-   `useContainer`

        	A boolean value that determines if a View container is wrapped around the WebView. The default value is true. If you are using your own View to wrap this library around, set this value to false.

`RichEditor` also has methods that can be used on its `ref` to set:

-   `setContentHTML(html:string)`
-   `insertImage(url:string)`
-   `setContentFocusHandler(handler: Function)`
-   `blurContentEditor()`
-   `focusContentEditor()`

This method registers a function that will get called whenver the cursor position changes or a change is made to the styling of the editor at the cursor's position., The callback will be called with an array of `actions` that are active at the cusor position, allowing a toolbar to respond to changes.

-   `registerToolbar(listener: Function)`

### Example Usage:

```javascript
<RichEditor
    ref={(r) => (this.richtext = r)}
    initialContentHTML={'Hello <b>World</b> <p>this is a new paragraph</p> <p>this is another new paragraph</p>'}
    editorInitializedCallback={() => this.onEditorInitialized()}
/>
```

## `RichToolbar`

This is a Component that provides a toolbar for easily controlling an editor. It is designed to be used together with a `RichEditor` component.

The `RichToolbar` has one required property:

-   `getEditor()`

Which must provide a **function** that returns a `ref` to a `RichEditor` component.

This is because the `ref` is not created until after the first render, before which the toolbar is rendered. This means that any `ref` passed directly will inevitably be passed as `undefined`.

Other props supported by the `RichToolbar` component are:

-   `actions`

        	An `array` of `actions` to be provided by this toolbar. The default actions are:
        	* `actions.insertImage`
        * `actions.setBold`
        * `actions.setItalic`
        * `actions.insertBulletsList`
        * `actions.insertOrderedList`
        * `actions.insertLink`

-   `onPressAddImage`

    Functions called when the `addImage` actions are tapped.

-   `selectedButtonStyle`
-   `iconTint`
-   `selectedIconTint`
-   `unselectedButtonStyle`

    These provide options for styling action buttons.

-   `iconSize`

    Defines the size of the icon in pixels. Default is 50.

-   `renderAction`

        	Altenatively, you can provide a render function that will be used instead of the default, so you can fully control the tollbar design.

-   `iconMap`

        	`RichTextToolbar` comes with default icons for the default actions it renders. To override those, or to add icons for non-default actions, provide them in a dictionary to this prop.

### Example Usage:

```javascript
<RichToolbar getEditor={() => this.richtext} />
```

#### With Custom Action:

To define your own custom action:

-   Send your action name as string in the `actions` array.
-   Include an icon for it with the `iconMap`
-   Add a function prop with the same action name to be called on tap

```javascript
<RichToolbar
	getEditor={() => this.richtext}
		actions={[
			actions.setBold,
			actions.setItalic,s
			actions.insertBulletsList,
			actions.insertOrderedList,
			actions.insertImage,
			'customAction',
		]}
		iconMap={{
			customAction: customIcon,
		}}
		customAction={this.handleCustomAction}
/>
```
